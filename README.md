Day 1:
I finished importing, and creating the scanner. Getting inputs from the user. I finished the outline of the entire code basically. 

Day 2:
I finished creating the story, then after each input added it to the story. For example lets say the story was: Bob has a (noun) and he was very (adjective).
After I get the first input from the user lets say he said turtle. Then it would print out: Bob has a turtle and he was very (adjective). And I would continue this process untill all the words were substituted.
I did this because I had to track my progress.
The hardest part about this was actualy creating the story, because I am not a very creative individual and I wasn't sure how to create one, so I asked my good friend arnav what he thought. He said it was fine :)
