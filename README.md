Day 1:
I finished importing, and creating the scanner. Getting inputs from the user. I finished the outline of the entire code basically. 

Day 2:
I finished creating the story, then after each input added it to the story. For example lets say the story was: Bob has a (noun) and he was very (adjective).
After I get the first input from the user lets say he said turtle. Then it would print out: Bob has a turtle and he was very (adjective). And I would continue this process untill all the words were substituted.
I did this because I had to track my progress.
The hardest part about this was actualy creating the story, because I am not a very creative individual and I wasn't sure how to create one, so I asked my good friend arnav what he thought. He said it was fine :)

Day 3: It turns out I did the entir program wrong. I was suppose to replace it, but not manually. So the user types in the input, and instead of me preinting it the replacement, the progam needed to do that. So I fixed that. Initially I used the .replace function to do the job, but Mr.Baez said it works, but to try and get familiar with the .substring so I created two programs for that.
